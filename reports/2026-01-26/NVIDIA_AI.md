- Post: As AI labs race to train and deploy new frontier models, existing models become more affordable with better tokenomics. ✨ "Everybody's trying to get to the next frontier. And every time they get to the next frontier, the last generation AI tokens, the cost starts to decline about a factor of 10x every year," said NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang in a recent keynote. Model optimization techniques such as speculative decoding and multi-token prediction, combined with inference serving platforms like NVIDIA Dynamo on NVIDIA Blackwell NVL72 systems, enable AI factories to boost throughput by 10x with one-tenth of the cost per token.
